# Deep Neural Network implementation in Pytorch

Informal implementation from scratch for educational purpose.

## Tools
- Use `pip-compile` to update Python requirements files. Can be installed with: `python3 -m pip install pip-tools`.
- Use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to automate static checks:
```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```
